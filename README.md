# leetcode-go

Every single leetcode problem.

Problems are done in go if possible, otherwise python. SQL problems are done in mysql.

## Structure

Problems are grouped into folders based on the first 2 digits and named based on the problem url (e.g. problem 21 "Merge two sorted lists" is in `00/21-merge-two-sorted-lists/`).

General utilities are in the `util` folder and are copied (and often modified) into solutions that use them.
